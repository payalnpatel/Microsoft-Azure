### Fundamental AI Concepts
- Machine learning - often the foundation of an AI system, and is the way we "teach" a computer model to make predictions and draw conclusions from data.
  - Microsoft Azure provides the Azure Machine Learning services - a cloud-based platform for creating, managing, and publishing machine learning models. Azure Machine Learning Studio offers multiple authoring experiences such as: automated machine learning, Azure Machine Learning Designer (no-code development of ml solutions), Data metric visulaization, and Notebooks 
- Computer vision - capabilities within AI to interpret the world visually through cameras, video, and images
  - area of AI that deals with visual processing
  - Seeing AI app - designed for the blind and low vision community, this app harnesses AI to open up the visual world and describe nearby people, text and objects
  - most computer vision solutions are based on ML models that can be applied to visual input from cameras, videos, or images.
  - Common computer vision tasks:
      - Image classification - training a ML model to classify images based on their contents.
      - Object classification - these ML models are tarined to classify individual objects within an image, and identify their location with a bounding box. ex. idenitfy the location of different classes of vehicle.
      - semantic segmentation - an advanced ML technique in which individual pixels in the image are classified accordoing to the object to which they belong.
      - Image analysis - extract information from images, including 'tags', that can help catalog the image or even descriptive captions that summarize the sceen show in the image
      - Face detection, analysis, and recognition - face detection is a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces in an image.
      - Optical character recognition (OCR) - a technique used to detect and read text in images. you can use OCR to read text in photographs or to extract information from scanned documents such as letters, invoices, or forms.
  - Computer vision services in Microsoft Azure
    - Microsoft's Azure AI vision to develop computer vision solutions. some features include: image analysis, face, and optical character recognition (OCR) 
- Natural language processing - capabilities within AI for a computer to interpret written or spoken language, and respond in kind
  - NLP is the area of AI that deals with creating software that understands written and spoken language.
  - NLP enables you to: analyze and interpret text in documents, email messages, and other sources; interpret spoken language and syntehsize speech resposnes; automatically translate spoken or written phrases between languages; interpet commands and determine appropriate actions.
  - Microsoft's Azure AI Language tool - can be used to build NLP solutions. Azure AI speech used to buiold NLP solutions too.
- Document intelligence - capabilities within AI that deal with managing, processing, and using high volumes of data found in forms and documents
  - deals with managing, processing, and using high volumes of a variety of data found in forms and documents.
  - Azure AI Document Intelligence - build solutions that manage and accelerate data collection from scanned documents. 
- Knowledge mining - capabilities within AI to extract information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store
  - solutions that involve extracting information from large volumes of often unstructured data to create a searchable knowledge store.
  - Azure AI Search - has a tool for buiding indexews. The indexes can be used for internal use only, or to enable searchable content on public facing internet assets. 
- Generative AI - capabilities within AI that create original content in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and more
  - describes a category of capabilities within AI that create original content. people typically interact with gen AI that has been built into chat apps.
  - Gen AI apps take in natural language input, and return appropriate responses in a variety of formats including natural language, image, code, and audio.
  - Azure OpenAI service - cloud solution for deploying, customizing, and hosting gen AI models.
 
- Challenges and risks with AI
  - bias can affect results
  - errors may cause harm
  - data could be exposed
  - solutions may not work for everyone
  - users must trust a complex system
  - who's liable for AI-driven decisions?
 
- Responsible AI
  - Fairness
  - Reliability and safety
  - Privacy and security
  - Inclusiveness
  - Transparency
  - Accountability
