## Describe Cloud Concepts

### Describe Cloud Computing
- <b>Cloud Computing:</b> The delivery of computing services over the internet (which is otherwise known as the cloud).These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.  Cloud computing offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.  
- <b>Shared Responsibility Model:</b> 
- Cloud Models (Public, Private, Hybrid)
- Use cases for each cloud model
- Consumption-based Model:
- Cloud Pricing Models: 

### Describe the Benefits of Using Cloud Services
Describe the benefits of using cloud services
• describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud
• describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud
• describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud
• describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud

### Describe Cloud Service Types
- <b>Cloud Service Models:</b> define the different levels of shared responsibility that a cloud provider and cloud tenant are responsible for. 
- <b>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):</b> the cloud provider keeps hardware up-to-date, but operating system maintenance and network configuration is up to the cloud tenant.
  - aims to give complete control over the hardware that runs your application 
  - the most flexible cloud service, you configure and manage the hardware for your app
- <b>Platform as a Service (PaaS):</b> the cloud provider managers the VMs and networking resources, and the cloud tenant deploys their apps in to the managed hosting environment.
  - focus on app dev, platform management is handled by the cloud provider 
- <b>Software as a Service (SaaS):</b> the cloud provider manages all aspects of the application environment, such as VMs, networking resources, data storage, and applications.  The cloud tenant only needs to provide their data to the app managed by the cloud provider.
  - software that is centrally hosted and managed for you and your customers/users
Describe cloud service types
• identify appropriate use cases for each cloud service (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

## Describe Azure Architecture and Services

### Describe the Core Architectural Components of Azure
- regions: different geographical locations around the globe that contain Azure datacenters. A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.  
- 
- Organzinging structure for resources in Azure has 4 levels - management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources 
  - <b>resources:</b> instances of services that you create (i.e. VMs, storage, SQL DBs, etc.) 
    - resources are created in regions 
  - <b>resource groups:</b> resources are combined into resource groups, which act as a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
  - <b>subscriptions:</b> a subscription groups together user accounts and the resources that have been created by those user accounts.  For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources that you can create and use.  Organizations can use subscriptoins to manage costs and the resources that are created by users, teams, or projects.
  - <b>management groups:</b> these groups help you manage access, policy, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. all subscriptions in a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.
